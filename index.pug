								| In the Netherlands 1 out of 3 students quits their studies in the
								| first education year. Because of this a lot of time, money and qualities 
								| gets wasted. The reason for this, is that high school students do not realize 
								| which choice they have to make and therefor most of them do not spend enough
								| time collecting information about studies, see only a few studies and make a hasty
								| choice in the end when the deadline approaches.

								| Next is a concept that helps high school students to make a more
								| aware choice for an education. To do this it uses game- and social elements
								| to motivate the students to put a lot more time and effort into their study choice.
								| Besides that it guides students through a clear pad with easy assignments and
								| keeps track of all the students activities.
